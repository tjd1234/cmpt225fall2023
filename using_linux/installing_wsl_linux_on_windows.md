If you are using Windows, here is a good way to work with C++ and Linux:

- Install [WSL2 Ubuntu](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install).
  This us the easiest way to install Linux on Windows.
- Install Visual Studio Code [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). This is
  a popular programming editor that works with WSL and C++ (and many other
  languages).
  - Install [the WSL extension for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/blogs/2019/09/03/wsl2).
  - Install [the C++ extensions for VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/languages/cpp).
  - In VS Code, the command **ctrl-`** opens a terminal window where you can
    interact with the Linux command line. There are many other useful commands
    for VS Code, and it's worthwhile to spend a bit of time browsing the web for
    tutorials and recommendations for other extensions.

After you've got Ubuntu Linux installed, [set up your C++ environment](README.md).
